# NeverCrypt

NeverCrypt is a virtual disk encryption software for Android which allows you to store your files in an encrypted container. It is a fork of EDS Lite, the open source edition of EDS. Visit the [EDS web site](https://sovworks.com/eds/) to learn about EDS features and capabilities.

NeverCrypt is trying to be a bit different, in that it tries to focus on opening containers and providing access to them. So, its integrated file manager will only open contents of encrypted containers, and not try to be a general file manager.
It aiming to be a more modern alternative, by modern UI components and Android features. It requires at least Android 5.0 Lollipop, because it is using the Android Storage Access Framework, and requires absolutely no additional permissions - not even direct access to the file system.
